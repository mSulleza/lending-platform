# Data Security in Lending Platform

## Overview

The Lending Platform implements a user-based data isolation model to ensure that each user can only access their own data. This prevents unauthorized access to client information and loan schedules.

## Key Security Features

1. **User Authentication**: Uses NextAuth.js with Google OAuth for secure user authentication
2. **Data Isolation**: Each client and loan schedule is mapped to a specific user
3. **Request Validation**: All API endpoints verify that the requested data belongs to the authenticated user
4. **Middleware Protection**: Routes are protected by middleware that enforces authentication

## Data Model

- Each **User** has many **Clients**
- Each **Client** belongs to a single **User**
- Each **Client** has many **LoanSchedules**
- Access to **LoanSchedules** is restricted through their relationship to **Clients**

## Implementation Details

- When a user logs in, a User record is automatically created in the database
- All API requests for clients and loan schedules check that the data belongs to the current user
- No cross-user data access is possible through the API endpoints

## For Developers

When working with data in the application:

1. Always include the user context when creating new clients
2. Always verify user ownership when retrieving data
3. Use the auth middleware and data access patterns from existing endpoints for any new features

This ensures that the data isolation model is consistently applied throughout the application.
